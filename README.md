# 3D-BioWaste
This was the first ever Hackathon I ever attended, and we were told to make a prototype as well as a process that supports a circular and sustainable economy. We decided to make "3D BioWaste" where we would take plastic waste from large corporations and burn them down to filaments to use as 3D printing "ink" to make prosthetics. These prosthetics would be much cheaper than traditional ones, and all in all had a fun and life changing experience.

## How to run code
For this code to work, simply use any HTML IDE or Notepad, the one I used to make this website was Sublime Text 3, so just have these two files open, the .html & .css and when you build the file, you will be able to see my predictions.

## Sublime Text 3
